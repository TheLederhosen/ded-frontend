# DED Designing a siemens-themed air quality detector 

The following project is a angular-based frontend that was part of our project for the class "Designing an Electronic Device for Business and Production" at Aalto University. As part of this project we designed and evaluated the creation of a new air-quality detector for business applications, as well as implementing and 3D-printing a prototype. This frontend acts as a webserver querying data from our arduino backend, which runs a CO2 sensor, and then presenting it to the enduser in a visual manner. I used Angular since I had some previous experience with it from my own university. The current state of the project is very minimal. The connection details are hardcoded and the frontend only implements basic components. 

This project will likely not be developed further. 

## How to install and run the project

Install Node.js Version 19.9.0 along with npm V9.6.4. Then navigate to the root folder of the project and execute `npm install`. Based on the *package.json* file, npm will download all required node_modules to run an Angular application. Afterwards, execute `npm install -g @angular/cli` to install the Angular CLI globally.
